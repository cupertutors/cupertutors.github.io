					<h4>AMC 8 - <i>Competitive Math</i></h4>
					<p> The AMC 8 is a nation-wide mathematics competition with students from Grades 8 and below competing. It is a 25 problem, 40 minute test including challenging problems that cover geometry, algebra, combinatorics, counting, probability, and more. Although there is no contest after the AMC 8 for high scoring students, doing well on this exam is a good indicator of success in other mathematics competitions. This course will cover topics that will be tested as well as a large majority of questions on the contests. Students need no previous knowledge other than a solid understanding of the math courses that they have covered in school, including pre-algebra, algebra, and for some, geometry. We will build on previous knowledge as well as provide a multitude of new strategies and topics that will help students succeed on this contest.<br><br>More information about the American Mathematics Competitions can be found <a href = "http://www.maa.org/math-competitions/about-amc">here</a>.</p>

					<h4>AMC 10 - <i>Competitive Math</i></h4>
					<p> The AMC 10 is a nation-wide mathematics competition with students from Grade 10 and below competing. It is a 25 problem, 75 minute test including challenging problems that cover arithmetic, algebra, counting, geometry, number theory, probability, and other secondary school mathematics topics. If one scores high enough, they will qualify for the prestigious AIME contest, or the American Invitational Mathematics Examination. This course will cover topics that will be tested as well as a large majority of questions on the contests. Students will need an adequate understanding in most of the tested areas. We will build on previous knowledge as well as provide a multitude of new strategies and tips that will help students succeed on this contest.<br><br>More information about the American Mathematics Competitions can be found <a href = "http://www.maa.org/math-competitions/about-amc">here</a>.</p>

					<h4>USACO Bronze - <i>Competitive Programming</i></h4>
					<p> USACO is a worldwide, online computer science competition that involves thousands of students. Every school year, four online competitions take place and those who score well in these competitions ascend in rank, with every student beginning in Bronze. The highest ranking this year is Platinum. Students who are able to reach the highest level can possibly be chosen into a top-24 student team and compete to be a part of the United States team, which then competes in the International Olympiad of Informatics. Prerequisites for this course include a laptop which you can program on. No previous computer science knowledge is needed to apply for this course, as our tutors will cover basic computer science principles to students who do not have any prior experience.<br><br>More information about the USA Computing Olympiad can be found <a href = "http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=contests​">here</a>.</p>

					<h4>Chemistry Olympiad Local Round - <i>Competitive Science</i></h4>
					<p> Chemistry Olympiad is a worldwide competition that aims to inspire students around the world to pursue chemistry or chemistry related subjects. The Olympiad consists of two main parts: the local exam and the national exam.  The local exam consists of the introductory parts of general chemistry, while the national exam goes more in depth into general chemistry and touches on organic chemistry. This course will aim to teach students the content and tricks behind the local exam and will touch on the more in depth aspects of the national exam. No background in chemistry is required, but it will definitely help. Particularly skilled students will be taught how to excel in the national exam, and make the study camp. This course will be based off resources from the olympiad website and off materials from past international chemistry olympiad winners.<br><br>More information about the Chemistry Olympiad can be found <a href = "http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/students/highschool/olympiad.html​">here</a>.</p>
